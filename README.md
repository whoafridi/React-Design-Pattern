## Layout Pattern in React.

A common and effective way to structure React applications is by implementing a layout pattern, where a parent `Layout` component wraps around various pages or sections of the app. This pattern promotes consistency, reusability, and cleaner architecture.

### Advantages of This Layout Pattern

- Reusability :
  Shared UI components like the Navbar, Sidebar, or Footer remain consistent across all pages.

- Better Code Organization :
  Keeps layout logic separate from page-specific content, leading to a more modular and maintainable codebase.

- Easier Maintenance :
  Updating layout elements in one place automatically reflects across the entire application.
